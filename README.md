Game On: Leveraging Box Office Trends for Microsoft's Movie Studio


## Overview
My aim is to  dive into the current  microsoft box office landscape, uncovering trends that can empower Microsoft's  movie studio to make strategic decisions about its film . By analyzing popular genres,top grossing films, audience demographics, and distribution strategies that will provide actionable insights to guide the studio towards box office success.

## Business Understanding
Microsoft lacks experience in the film industry and wants to establish a movie studio.
In order to determine which movies the corporation should invest in most strategically, I have been entrusted with looking over box office data.

To help me reach my goal, I made the decision to divide the primary target into smaller, more focused goals, like these:

1.To determine the demographic we want to target in order to create material that will appeal to them and help Microsoft achieve box office success.

2.To ascertain the method of distribution to be employed for seeing the films—in theaters or on streaming services—so that the business can capitalize on it.

3.Using the data analysis, to determine which movie genres are the most strategically important to generate.

4.To identify the highest grossing movies in which the business can make investments by examining the production costs in order to optimize profits.
